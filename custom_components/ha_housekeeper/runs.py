"""Automation and script runs, counted once and kept as daily numbers.

Home Assistant keeps only a few traces per automation, so the collector reads their short heads
now and then and counts every finished run exactly once. It stores counters per day, the structural
step where a run failed, and nothing else: no variables, payloads, trigger data or error texts.
The extended trace, which carries variables, is never read.
