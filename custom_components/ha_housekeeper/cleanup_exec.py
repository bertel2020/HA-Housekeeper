"""Executing confirmed cleanup plans. This is the only module that changes Home Assistant.

Entities:

* ``disable_entity`` quarantines an entity by disabling it. Nothing is deleted, history and
  statistics are never touched, and the step can be undone while the entity is unchanged.
* ``remove_entity`` removes the registry entry of an entity that has been in quarantine for at
  least ``QUARANTINE_DAYS``. A Home Assistant backup is created first and must complete, and the
  entry is stored in the journal so that it can be restored.

Devices (same quarantine and backup rules; removing a device also removes its entities):

* ``disable_device`` quarantines a device.
* ``remove_device`` uses the official path: the integration is asked and may refuse.
* ``forget_device`` removes the registry entry although the integration offers no removal, then
  reloads the integration. Hubs and devices with children are never touched.

References:

* ``replace_references`` rewrites exact references to one entity in automations, scripts, scenes,
  storage dashboards and the Energy dashboard. Each source is stored in the journal before it is
  rewritten and put back on undo while it is still exactly as Housekeeper left it.

Meters:

* ``migrate_meter`` joins the long-term statistics of a replaced meter in front of its successor
  (experimental: it writes into the recorder database, so a backup is mandatory and statistics
  cannot be undone) and/or lets the new entity take over the old entity ID. The old entity moves
  to a free ``_alt`` ID; Home Assistant moves history and statistics along with every rename.

Counters:

* ``repair_counter`` replaces the wrong readings of a counter in the raw states and in both
  statistics tables and rebuilds the sums that the wrong readings spoiled. The overwritten values
  stay in the journal, so the repair can be undone while the rows are still as it left them.

Every step is re-checked right before it runs, journaled, and the run stops at the first surprise.
