"""Housekeeper's own safety backups: list them, suggest which ones can go, delete them.

Housekeeper makes a backup before risky plans, named "Housekeeper <plan>" and marked in its
metadata. Home Assistant does not delete those by itself. Only backups with that mark are ever
listed or deleted, never the person's regular ones. A backup is protected while its plan is still
watched and while it is the newest one that still allows an undo.
