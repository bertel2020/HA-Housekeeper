"""How well a diagnosis is supported: the certainty of a finding.

Not a probability and not how bad the finding is. Every rule has a level by the kind of proof it rests
on (a fact in the registry or the configuration, a report of Home Assistant, a conclusion from state or
time, a guess); named adjustments move the value for the single finding, and a follow-up is never more
certain than its cause. The amounts are fixed, not measured. ``confidence_notes`` says what was applied.
