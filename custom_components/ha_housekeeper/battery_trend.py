"""When a battery will probably reach the low limit, from the daily means of its statistics.

Only the long-term statistics of working battery sensors are read (daily means over about a month),
never single states. The number is an estimate by a straight line through the days since the last
replacement (a jump up of 15 points or more) and is shown as such. With too few days, a flat or a
rising curve nothing is promised. Grouping puts batteries that run low within the same fortnight
together, so several changes can be done in one round.
