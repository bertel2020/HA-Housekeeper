"""Taking an entity out of the assistants, or giving Google its PIN back: what a plan reads and writes.

The exposure of an entity is not part of its registry fingerprint, so this module keeps its own: a
hash of the options Home Assistant stores per assistant. Only two things are ever written, the
``should_expose`` flag of an assistant and the ``disable_2fa`` option of Google. Nothing is added to
an assistant, and bridges (HomeKit) are left alone.
