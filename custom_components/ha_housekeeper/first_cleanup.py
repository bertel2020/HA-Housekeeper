"""The cleanup ("Aufräumen"): five stages through the open findings, and where the house stands.

The stages are cut from the topics and the impact, with no outline of their own: (1) outages that
hold up many follow-ups, (2) suggestions for marks (the panel's card; it has no findings of its own
here), (3) high or medium impact of the other topics but "Unneeded", (4) "Unneeded" as a cleanup
round, (5) the rest, low or info impact, put off together. One record for the whole house, not per
user: when it began, the stage, how many findings were open then, which stages are done.
