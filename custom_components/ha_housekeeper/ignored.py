"""Decisions about findings: hidden, meant to be so ("keep"), or put off until later ("snooze").

Stored by Housekeeper only; Home Assistant objects stay untouched. Each entry says what was decided
(``kind``), why (``reason``), until when (``until``, optional) and by whom. An entry whose time has
passed no longer hides the finding; it stays so the finding can be shown as due again.
A decision outlives its finding: when the object works again, the entry rests and holds again the
next time. ``seen`` is when a full scan last found the finding, so a resting entry can say how long
its finding has been away.
A "later" remembers how bad its finding was (``impact_at``, ``followers_at``); when the scan finds it
worse, the decision is lifted (``worse``) and the finding comes back as due.
