"""Which findings began at about the time of a logged event (an update, a restart, a plan run).

Only reads the findings of the last scan and Housekeeper's own event log. The result says that two
things happened at about the same time, never that one caused the other. Restarts and plan runs
touch almost everything, so they only appear as groups, not as a line on each finding.
