"""What is new on the access page, and what was meant to be so.

Stored by Housekeeper only, per integration entry: the level it was given, when it was first seen
(empty for the first look: that is "before tracking", never new) and, when somebody said so, that
its access is meant to be so. Never a value, a detail of an access or a name, only the entry id and
a level. A level that rises lifts the decision, and a rise is shown for a while like a new entry.
The credentials page keeps its own decisions apart (``secret_known``): the empty fields of an entry
that are meant to be so, with how many were empty then; more of them lifts the decision.
