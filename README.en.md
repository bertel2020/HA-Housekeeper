HA Housekeeper is a maintenance and analysis integration for Home Assistant. It creates a clear inventory of your installation, explains suspicious or orphaned objects, and shows how entities, devices, integrations, areas, and automations depend on each other.

The goal is not aggressive automatic cleanup. Housekeeper helps you understand what exists, why something is considered problematic, and what would be affected before any future cleanup operation is introduced.

> Housekeeper reads and analyzes first. It changes something only after you explicitly confirm a plan: disabling entities (quarantine) and, after at least 14 days of quarantine and a successful backup, removing them. The same applies to devices (disable, then remove after quarantine or forget locally). Housekeeper can also replace references to an old entity with a new one. Much of this can be undone while the configuration is unchanged. Integrations and hubs are never modified, and Housekeeper changes only what a confirmed plan names. It also stores only its own data (observation times, scan history, hidden findings, journal).

## What Housekeeper does

| Task | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Inventory** | Entities, devices, integrations, areas, floors, labels, and automations with search, filters, and sorting |
| **Diagnostics** | Distinguishes active, unavailable, unknown, disabled, and orphaned objects, each with a reason |
| **Observation time** | Stores since when Housekeeper has observed a classification |
| **Automation analysis** | Triggers, conditions, actions, blueprints, and missing references; likewise for scripts, scenes, dashboards, groups, and helpers |
| **Scan comparison** | New and resolved findings, status changes, new and removed objects since the last scan |
| **Cleanup hints** | Possible duplicates, unused automations, low batteries |
| **Sensors and hints** | Counters as sensors, aggregated repair hints, export as CSV/JSON |
| **Dependencies** | Relationships between integration, device, entity, area, and automation with a confidence level |
| **Safety** | Administrators only; reads and analyzes, changes only after explicit confirmation (quarantine, then removal with a backup; devices; replacing references; meter change) |

## Why HA Housekeeper?

Mature Home Assistant installations often accumulate registry entries, unavailable entities, replaced devices, old statistics, and automation references that are difficult to assess safely. A missing state alone does not explain whether an entity was intentionally disabled, whether its integration is disabled, or whether the underlying device no longer exists.

Housekeeper combines registry data and the live Home Assistant runtime to provide that context in one administrator-only panel.

## Installation

### Via HACS (recommended)

[![Open the HACS repository in My Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=bertel2020&repository=HA-Housekeeping&category=integration)
[![Add HA Housekeeper to My Home Assistant](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=ha_housekeeper)

1. Use the first button to open the Housekeeper repository in HACS.
2. Download **HA Housekeeper** and restart Home Assistant.
3. Use the second button to add the integration. Alternatively, open
   **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration → HA Housekeeper** in
   Home Assistant.
4. Then open **Housekeeper** in the sidebar while signed in as an administrator.

If the first button does not work, add
`https://github.com/bertel2020/HA-Housekeeping` in HACS under **Integrations →
Custom repositories** with the category **Integration**.

### Manual

Copy the `custom_components/ha_housekeeper` directory to
`/config/custom_components/ha_housekeeper` and restart Home Assistant. Then add
the integration as described above.

The resulting directory should look like this:

```text
config/
└── custom_components/
    └── ha_housekeeper/
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── manifest.json
        └── ...
```

## Features

### Installation overview

- Inventory of entities, devices, integrations/config entries, areas, floors, labels, and automations
- Search by name, object ID, unique ID, platform, or integration
- Filter by object type and status
- Sortable and paginated inventory for larger installations
- Summary of object counts and current findings

### Entity and device diagnostics

Housekeeper distinguishes between:

- an active entity with a current state
- an entity reporting `unknown`
- an entity reporting `unavailable`
- an intentionally disabled entity
- an entity belonging to a disabled device
- an entity belonging to a disabled integration
- an entity whose device no longer exists in the device registry
- an entity whose config entry no longer exists
- a registry entity that no longer has a state

For every continuously observed classification, Housekeeper stores when it first detected that condition. This timestamp is explicitly presented as a **first Housekeeper observation**, not as an invented deletion or failure date.

### Automation analysis

- Lists loaded automations and their current state
- Shows mode, concurrency limits, last trigger time, and blueprint origin
- Displays triggers, conditions, and actions in the detail view; the **Flow** tab shows them as a tree (if/then, repeats, parallel steps) with a plain sentence per step, clickable entities, and steps with missing objects or findings marked red
- Extracts entity, device, area, floor, and label references
- Includes references detected by the Home Assistant runtime, including many template references
- Detects references whose target no longer exists
- Retains the precise configuration location for explicit references when available
- Scripts, scenes and dashboards are checked for references and missing targets in the same way; the detail page shows under **Impact of removal** what a removal would affect (analysis only, no changes)

### Changes since the last scan

The **Changes** view compares the current state with the previous scan or with the last scan of each earlier day (kept for 30 days by default, adjustable from 1 to 365 under Settings, with a timeline of the stored scans): status changes (worsened first), new and resolved findings, and new and removed objects. The history is stored compactly in Home Assistant and contains only statuses and IDs.

### More views and sources

- **Hide findings**: a finding can be hidden on the detail page (only in Housekeeper's own list, Home Assistant stays untouched). Alternatively the label `housekeeper_ignore` on an entity hides all of its findings. Hidden findings do not count in the overview, sensors, or repair hints and can be shown again with **Show hidden**. When hiding you choose the kind: **Hidden**, **Kept on purpose** (a reason is required) or **Remind me later**, optionally with a duration (7, 30, 90 or 365 days). When the time runs out the finding returns to the list, marked **Due again** and filterable. The reason and the time show in the list of hidden findings.
- **Marks**: On the detail page (Relations tab) of a device or entity you tell Housekeeper what to expect: **Offline on purpose**, **Seasonal**, **Spare device**, **Being replaced** (with a target) or **Do not remove**, with a reason and optionally a review date (30, 90, 180 or 365 days). A mark hides “not available” on that object (on a device: on its entities), never a broken reference. **Do not remove** blocks every cleanup step on the object. After the review date the findings come back, marked as due. Marks live only in Housekeeper.
- **Impact**: Every finding has an impact (**high**, **medium**, **low**, **none**) with the reasons behind it, for example “used by 3 active automations” or “controls 1 critical object”. Objects are critical when they carry the label `housekeeper_critical` (on an entity, device or area), or are locks, alarm panels, valves, sirens, garage doors and gates, or sensors for smoke, gas, carbon monoxide, water and safety. The findings list sorts by impact by default, then by certainty of the diagnosis, and can be filtered by it. There is no numeric score.
- **Cleaning critical objects**: cleanup actions on critical objects (see Impact) ask for a separate confirmation per object, even when nothing else speaks against them. Policy violations can be hidden, kept (with a reason) or put off for later, like findings.
- **Common causes**: when an integration is not loaded, all its entities show as "unavailable". Housekeeper folds that into one cause ("Integration X is not loaded", with state, error text and the affected automations, scripts and dashboards). The same goes for a device with at least three entities that are all down. The block sits above the findings list and in "What should I do now?"; the follow-up findings stay folded until you choose **Show follow-up findings** (the export always includes them). Hidden and marked findings do not count. The health figure is unchanged; this is a hint, not proof.
- **Sensors**: Housekeeper creates a service device with counters (findings, orphaned and unavailable entities, broken references, possible duplicates, unused automations, low batteries, last scan) for use in dashboards and automations.
- **Batteries**: a dedicated view with all battery entities, lowest values first (low from 20 %, configurable).
- **Not used**: a view of active entities that appear in no automation, script, scene, group, helper, or readable dashboard (without diagnostic and configuration entities). Entities and orphaned statistics are shown in tables that can be filtered and sorted by column (entities: device, area, integration, last change, last report, observed since; statistics: kind, unit, last entry, Energy dashboard); on a phone they appear as cards. A hint only, not a finding: voice assistants, apps, auto-generated dashboards, and external systems are invisible to Housekeeper.
- **Overview**: below the key figures the **inventory status** shows three groups (Unremarkable, Check, Problematic) with count and share, followed by the findings. On the right come the trend, the **Database** card (size, WAL file, retention as set in the recorder of Home Assistant, growth per day; two file sizes only, no table queries), tidy-up and the objects by type. The key facts of an entity show the last state change, the last report and, with long-term statistics, the last statistics entry.
- **Policies (Maintain)**: your own rules for tidiness, switched on one by one and all off at first: entity without an area (only entities of physical devices, without diagnostic, configuration and disabled entities and without service devices), device without an area, automation without a description, battery entity without a device, duplicate display name (per domain), automation without a label (only automations with a registry entry) and naming scheme (one prefix per domain, up to 10, for example `wz_` for `sensor`). Violations are hints and do not count in health, findings, repair hints or sensors. The label `housekeeper_ignore` or **Hide** takes an object out; the switches live only in Housekeeper. Plus the rule “State changes per day” with an adjustable limit (default 5,000); it only reads the last calculated load numbers and never starts a recorder query. More rules: entity id with a trailing number, default name on an automation or script, script without a description or label, device without manufacturer or model, empty area, label without use, automation with more than 10 triggers, exposure without use, sensitive entity exposed, low battery without an automation, entity that writes a lot to the recorder but is unused, and long retention with a big database. These run as heuristics (a hint that can raise false alarms): automation without error handling, literal entity ids in templates, automation triggers itself, and “only ever turned on”.
- **Integrations with problems** appear on the overview, next to a **Tidy up** card with quick access to batteries, duplicates, unused automations, and unused entities.
- **Settings** (cog on the right of the top menu) with a header band (version, Home Assistant, objects, “Copy info”) and four tabs. **Appearance**: color scheme and mode as tiles, font size (small/normal/large), mode (automatic/light/dark), color scheme (Standard, Housekeeper, Modern), density (normal/compact), animation (like system/reduced), start view and entries per page; it is stored in your Home Assistant user profile (and in the browser as well). **Scan and thresholds**: scan interval and thresholds as cards with unit and default; saving is possible only after a change, and Housekeeper reloads afterwards. **Hidden**: show hidden findings again. **Info**: which data Housekeeper stores itself and for how long, plus links.
- **Cleanup**: the **Tidy up** view checks selected orphaned or long-unavailable entities in a dry run: no known use, to review, or blocked (certain use, working entity), including references and a note on long-term statistics. Housekeeper changes nothing at that point. A plan can be explicitly confirmed (type a word) and executed; **disabling** as quarantine (registry entry; history and statistics stay untouched) and, under the conditions below, **removal**, device cleanup, replacing references and the meter change are executable. Blocked entries never run, “to review” only with an individual confirmation. Every step is re-checked first; if an entity changed since the preview, the run aborts. Afterwards Housekeeper verifies the result. Most steps can be undone in the journal while the entity is unchanged; the long-term statistics of a meter change can only be reset with the backup. A quarantine card shows since when an entity has been in quarantine and when a later removal would earliest be possible (14 days). Every plan is in the journal (executed plans stay as the audit trail). **Removal** (deleting the registry entry) is possible only for entities that have been in quarantine for at least 14 days: Housekeeper first creates a Home Assistant backup with your backup settings, waits for it to complete successfully, and starts nothing otherwise. The registry entry is kept in the journal so a removed entity can be restored while its ID is free and the integration still exists; it is back in quarantine afterwards.
  **Devices** follow the same rules: *Disable* (quarantine) is only possible if no entity of the device works any more, nothing hangs off the device (hubs and coordinators are blocked) and nothing certainly uses it. Housekeeper shows child devices but never cleans them up; a device with child devices counts like a hub. *Remove* uses Home Assistant's official path (the integration is asked and may refuse) and is only possible after 14 days of quarantine and with a backup. *Forget locally* is meant only for integrations that offer no regular removal: Housekeeper removes the registry entry and reloads the integration; the source system (device, hub, cloud) stays unchanged, and if the device shows up again a **Returning devices** card says so. Removing a device also removes its entities; restoring recreates the registry entry from the journal, and whether the integration provides the entities again is up to it. That is why every removal needs an individual confirmation.
  **Replace references** swaps an old entity for a new one wherever it is entered exactly: automations, scripts and scenes (YAML files), storage-mode dashboards and the Energy dashboard. The preview lists the changes per source. Templates, YAML dashboards, helpers and files using `!secret`/`!include` are not changed by Housekeeper but listed for you to adjust by hand. Each source is saved in the journal first (comments in YAML files are lost on writing, as with the Home Assistant editor; undo writes the original file back byte for byte while it is unchanged, otherwise only the changed item), a backup is mandatory, and undo works while the source is still exactly as Housekeeper left it. History and statistics are not moved or merged (the meter change does that).
  **Meter change** joins the history of a replaced meter with the new one. Housekeeper first checks that both statistics fit together (same unit and type) and shows the switch point, gaps, overlaps and the transition of the total in advance. There are three ways: copy the old meter's long-term statistics in front of the new one's and shift the new total by the old final reading (the raw readings of the new meter stay as they are), let the new meter take over the old one's ID (the old one moves to a free `_alt` ID; Home Assistant moves history and statistics along with the ID, and automations and dashboards keep working without rewriting), or both. Existing values are never overwritten: overlapping values of the old meter are not copied. Writing the statistics is experimental, requires the backup and can only be reset with it; the ID takeover can be given back through the journal. Only the hourly long-term statistics are joined, not the raw states and not the short-term statistics of the last days. Afterwards the old meter can go into quarantine.
- **Maintenance**: the **Maintenance** view starts with **Backup protection**: Housekeeper judges whether the backup strategy is sound (age of the latest backup against the schedule, failed runs and targets, local and remote storage, unusual size, retention, encryption, backup before cleanups). Home Assistant cannot detect the emergency kit and a restore test, so you confirm them with a date, and Housekeeper reminds you of the restore test after 180 days. Housekeeper only reads, starts no backup and never restores by itself. Below is the **update preflight**: backup age, open repairs, failed integrations, missing references and pending updates. If you save the starting state before an update, Housekeeper shows after the update (version change) new repairs, newly failed integrations, new missing references and new and removed objects. Both only read; the only thing stored is the starting state.
- **Reliability**: the **Reliability** view (Operation menu) shows for each config entry how available its entities were over the last 24 hours or 7 days, when at least 80 % of them (at least three, for at least 5 minutes) failed together, and whether that looks more like the cloud or like the device and network (named as a guess). Entities that were down all the time are counted apart. Housekeeper only reads the recorder for this, in the background, and remembers the last result (also across a restart, and likewise for load and database in the Recorder view): the view opens at once with the last numbers ("As of …") and recalculates in the background; for windows that were opened once it recalculates every 30 minutes. Every row opens the integration; its detail page has a **Reliability** tab with the entities that were down. Below, **Unstable entities** lists entities that keep failing and coming back (unstable from 3 failures and 0.5 a day, flapping from 1.5 a day), with duration, time-of-day pattern and the number of automations that depend on them. Failures during a shared outage of the integration count for the integration. On an entity's detail page “flapping” or “unstable” appears with the same numbers in the diagnosis and the key facts (from the last calculated result; the detail page never starts the recorder query).
- **Load**: The **Recorder** view (Operation menu) starts with the **load**; it shows which entities, integrations and events write the most to the recorder: rows per day and entity, the busiest hour, “updates without a new state” (the value stayed the same, only attributes changed; truly identical updates are not written by Home Assistant), the mean attribute size of the last 24 hours, the estimated load share of each integration (an extrapolation in percent, not a measurement in bytes) and the most frequent event types. Anything unusual comes first with its numbers and the objects that depend on it (automations, template sensors). Housekeeper only reads the recorder for this, in the background, remembers the last result like reliability does (the view opens at once with “As of …” and recalculates in the background) and changes no recorder setting; recommendations are text. If another recorder query is running, the panel asks again by itself.
- **Recorder costs**: Below the load, the **Recorder** view (Operation menu) shows the **recorder costs**: which entities fill the database, with share, write frequency, use and a suggested recorder exclusion to copy into `configuration.yaml`; Housekeeper does not change the recorder configuration.
- **Database**: The **Database** card in the Recorder view checks the recorder, read only: size of the database and WAL file (SQLite only; the daily size is noted as a number and gives the growth), duplicate statistics timestamps, hours missing from the statistics, statistics that do not fit their entity (unit, state class), and stretches of at least 10 minutes without a single entry, told apart as restart (according to Housekeeper's own log) and recorder gap. Each finding names numbers and a recommendation as text; Housekeeper repairs and deletes nothing. The calculation starts only when Maintenance is opened; problems then also appear in the overview tasks.
- **Exposure**: The **Exposure** entry under Maintain shows which entities Assist, Alexa, Google Assistant and HomeKit can reach and names what stands out: diagnostic entities, sensitive entities (locks, alarm panels, persons, trackers, garage doors; a hint only), exposure of disabled or orphaned entities, duplicate voice names and webhooks of integrations that no longer exist. Housekeeper reads metadata only: passwords, tokens, ports and webhook ids are neither read nor shown, and nothing is stored or changed. If a source does not answer, it says "cannot be checked".
- **Layout of the long views**: Reliability, Recorder, Automations, Policies and Exposure start with a row of key figures (traffic-light colour, a click jumps to the section) and are split into tabs with a counter and a mark for anything unusual; the chosen tab is kept in the address (`?tab=`). In Exposure every tile (Assist, Alexa, Google Assistant, HomeKit) shows the entities it reaches on a click; in Policies the rules (switches) and the violations are apart.
- **At about the same time as updates**: findings that began at the same time as an update of Home Assistant or an integration carry a note “At about the same time as …”, have a tile and a filter “New after update” and are grouped under Changes. Restarts and cleanup plans appear only as a group. It is a link in time, not a cause; only events since the event log counts.
- **History of a device**: the **History** tab on a device shows discovered, in quarantine, disabled by a plan, replaced or removed and whether it is unstable now, plus your own note (200 characters at most, kept only in Housekeeper). Under Maintenance the **Removed devices** tab lists what a plan removed.
- **Maintenance window (experimental, off by default)**: under Maintenance it guides you through the check, the starting state, a cleanup plan, the reload of the affected integrations, your restart and the comparison, ending with a Markdown report. Nothing runs on a timer, Housekeeper never restarts Home Assistant. It was tested with simulated steps, not yet in a real instance.
- **Lists remember**: sort and filters of every list come back at the next visit (this browser only, not the search text). In Findings you can tick several, hide them together or export them as CSV. In the graph, five or more alike leaves on one node fold into “12 × Entity”; a click opens the group.
- **Delete recorder leftovers** (Unused → Orphaned statistics): pick series and delete them after typing the word, optionally with the stored states. Housekeeper creates a Home Assistant backup first and only deletes if it succeeds; series in the Energy dashboard, existing entities and external statistics are left out. Afterwards only the backup brings them back.
- **Successor hints** when replacing references and on a meter change: similar active entities of the same domain (and unit) as buttons under the field. They only fill the field; nothing is chosen for you.
- **Weekly report**: under Changes, “Weekly report” saves the comparison with the state of about a week ago as a Markdown file (new and resolved findings, new and removed objects, status changes, loudest entities in the recorder when calculated).
- **Notification** (Settings → Scan, off by default): tells you in Home Assistant about each new broken reference once; switching it on announces nothing old.
- **Diagnostics file** (Settings → Info): numbers and versions only, no names, ids or attributes, fit for an issue.
- **Blueprints** (Maintenance): blueprint files nobody uses, and automations or scripts whose blueprint is missing or fails to load. Hints only.
- **Search in lists**: Long lists have a search box, also Automations (runs), Reliability (integrations, unstable entities), Recorder (loudest entities, findings, integrations), Policies and Exposure; it appears from six entries on.
- **Search and views**: The search box in the top menu finds entities, devices, integrations, automations and scripts by name, ID, platform, manufacturer and model; arrow keys and Enter open the hit. In the lists, search, filters and sort can be saved as a named **view** (in this browser only). Reliability can compare the period with the one before (percentage points per integration).
- **Automations** (Operation menu): every 15 minutes it counts the runs Home Assistant keeps for each automation and script for a short time (5 by default) and remembers for 60 days only counters per day and the place of a failure, no variables, data or error texts. The view names what stands out with the numbers behind it: many errors, runs rejected because of “Already running” or `max`, never successful, almost always ending at a condition, unusually frequent or long, the error rate after an update (as a coincidence in time), and waits of 5 minutes or more, waits without a timeout and `continue_on_error`. A run without an error does not mean the automation does its job. The list can be searched, filtered by type and “with errors” and sorted by column. On the detail page of an automation or script the key facts show runs, errors, condition, duration and the 7-day bars, and the **Runs** tab the details. Housekeeper also keeps a small log of version changes of Home Assistant and custom integrations and of restarts. Below it, **Conflicts and loops** lists two automations that control the same entity in opposite ways (on against off, two different fixed values) and can fire together (same trigger or overlapping time window), and chains of triggers and actions that lead back to the start through groups, helpers or other automations. Each finding has a stage: “possible” (only the configuration allows it), “observed” (all involved automations ran on the same day) or “repeated” (on at least 3 of 7 days); counting is per day, the order of the runs is unknown. Housekeeper runs nothing and never calls anything a certain error.
- **Recorder and Energy dashboard** are part of the impact analysis: entities of the Energy dashboard count as used, and entities with long-term statistics are marked. In the **Not used** view both tabs are sortable and filterable tables (a click on a column heading sorts; on the phone the rows become cards): the entities name domain, device, area, integration, last change, last report, since when they have been observed and whether there are long-term statistics. The **Orphaned statistics** tab lists long-term statistics that no longer have an entity (a hint only, Housekeeper deletes nothing; statistics used by the Energy dashboard are flagged). Each row names the **last entry** of the statistic and the list can be sorted by it (newest or oldest first), so recently orphaned statistics are easy to tell from long dead ones. The entry is read when the tab is opened, not during a scan.
- **Outdated scan**: if the last scan is clearly older than the scan interval, the overview says so. **Changes** and long lists of integration problems can be searched and filtered.
- **Long lists** are paged (default 20 per page, selectable 20/50/100) and can be searched, filtered, and sorted (findings, batteries, not used, inventory). The export contains exactly the findings shown.
- **More reference sources**: groups (members) and helpers such as template, derivative, or min/max sensors (source entities) are included in dependencies and impact analysis; missing members and sources are reported as findings.
- **Deep links**: the panel supports addresses like `/ha-housekeeper?view=findingsNav&filter=orphaned` or `?object=entity:sensor.x`; the repair hints use them.

### Dependency explorer

The dependency view visualizes direct relationships such as:

```text
Integration → owns → Device → provides → Entity
Floor → contains → Area → contains → Device
Automation → triggers on / checks / targets → Entity or Device
```

Each relationship includes a confidence level. Explicit registry and configuration relationships are marked as certain; references inferred by Home Assistant at runtime are identified separately.

### Findings, export, and repair hints

- Findings list with reasons and diagnosis confidence; export as **CSV** or **JSON** (respects the selected filter)
- Threshold for unavailable entities: under **Configure** you choose after how many days (default 7, `0` = immediately) an unavailable entity becomes a finding. Short outages, for example after a restart, are ignored. Orphaned entities are always reported immediately.
- **Possible duplicates**: a non-working entity with a number suffix (`…_2`) for which a working entity of the same integration with the same base ID exists is marked as a leftover
- **Unused automations**: switched off for a long time, not triggered for a long time, or never triggered (using the automation's age); threshold under **Configure** (default 90 days, `0` = off)
- **Automatic scan** every 24 hours (adjustable) keeps the history and repair hints current
- Hints under **Settings → Repairs**: at most three aggregated entries (orphaned entities, long-unavailable entities, automations with missing references) linking to the panel. They are informational only and offer no repair.
- **Diagnostics download** for bug reports (integration → Download diagnostics) contains counts only, no names or IDs.

### Languages

The panel and configuration flow are available in German and English. The active Home Assistant language determines which panel language is shown.

## Safety model

- The panel is available to Home Assistant administrators only.
- All Housekeeper WebSocket endpoints require administrator privileges.
- Housekeeper offers read and scan operations. It writes to its own storage (hidden findings, journal), to the integration options (at your request from the panel), and, for confirmed plans, to the entity and device registries (disabling, removal after quarantine and backup) as well as to automation, script and scene files, storage-mode dashboards and the Energy settings (replacing references, with a backup) and, for the meter change only and with a backup, the recorder's long-term statistics and entity IDs.
- `unavailable` is never treated as automatically orphaned.
- Disabled devices and integrations are distinguished from missing objects.
- No `.storage` file is edited directly.
- No cleanup action runs automatically.

Intentionally not part of Housekeeper: overwriting existing statistics values, rewriting raw recorder states and rewriting helpers or groups as a replacement source.

## Usage

Open **Housekeeper** from the Home Assistant sidebar. The overview starts with “What do I need to do now?” and shows what changed since the last scan, plus object totals, findings, and the time of the last scan.

- Select a category card to open a filtered inventory.
- Select an object: status, cause, device, area, and the risk of removing it are on top, with the tabs Overview, Dependencies, Technical data, and Attributes below, plus **Runs** for automations and scripts and **Reliability** for integrations.
- Open **Dependencies** and select an object to explore incoming and outgoing relationships. A switch toggles between list and graph (origin and users across up to three levels, with “What breaks on removal?”); small screens show only the list.
- Use **Scan now** to refresh the snapshot after configuration or device changes. Without intervention Housekeeper scans automatically every 24 hours.
- Under **Settings → Devices & services → HA Housekeeper → Configure** you can set four values: days until an unavailable entity becomes a finding (default 7), days until an automation counts as unused (default 90, `0` = off), the scan interval in hours (default 24, `0` = off), and the low-battery threshold in percent (default 20).
- The top menu is grouped: Overview (Overview, Findings, Changes), Operation (Reliability, Automations, Recorder), Explore (Inventory, Dependencies) and Maintain (Clean up, Not used, Batteries, Policies, Exposure, Maintenance).
- **Back**: detail pages, the graph and jumps through links have a “Back to …”. The graph goes back node by node and finally to the page it was opened from; detail pages reopen the tab you left, lists jump back to the old spot. The browser's back button does not follow these steps yet.

The first scan establishes the initial observation timestamps. Later scans preserve the start of an unchanged classification and reset it when the classification changes.

## Current limitations

- Housekeeper never cleans up automatically: every change needs a plan you confirmed. Four things are different:
  - *Confirmed cleanup*: disabling, removal, device cleanup, replacing references and the meter change run only as a confirmed plan, removal and the meter change after a Home Assistant backup.
  - *Undo in the journal*: Housekeeper restores registry entries, references and entity IDs while they are unchanged. Whether a device gets its entities back is up to the integration.
  - *Not undoable*: the joined long-term statistics of a meter change can only be reset with the backup.
  - *Full backup restore*: only Home Assistant itself does that; Housekeeper does not restore backups.
- Housekeeper needs Home Assistant 2026.8 or newer, because a device belongs to exactly one config entry there.
- Automation analysis covers automations currently loaded by Home Assistant. The amount of available detail can vary for invalid or externally managed automations.
- Dynamic templates cannot always be resolved to one definite target. Such relationships are never presented as certain without supporting runtime information.
- The dependency view focuses on direct relationships. The recorder (history, statistics) and unreadable or auto-generated dashboards are not part of the impact analysis; it is a hint, not a guarantee.
- Possible duplicates and unused automations are based on heuristics and are hints, not certainty.

## Development and validation

Housekeeper is tested automatically against Home Assistant 2026.8.3 (the minimum version) and the latest version the test package supports (locally and in the GitHub workflow, both required, with Python 3.14) and has been tried in a running instance on Home Assistant 2026.9.4. The test suite covers:

- manifest and package contracts
- German/English backend translation parity
- automation reference extraction and missing-target detection
- Config Flow creation and complete Config Entry setup
- registry and state inventory scanning, sources (scripts, scenes, dashboards, groups, helpers), scan comparison, hiding findings, and sensors
- policies, reliability, recorder queries (load, database) and the store for the last result, also with damaged files
- Python linting and formatting
- panel logic (views, filters, export, escaping) with Node.js
- Python and frontend syntax

The panel's source lives in `panel-src/` (several small files) and is built with `node scripts/build_panel.mjs` into the single file `custom_components/ha_housekeeper/frontend/ha-housekeeper-panel.js` that Home Assistant serves. Tests and CI verify with `--check` that it is current, so rebuild after changing `panel-src/`.

Run the dependency-free local tests with:

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
```

The GitHub validation workflow additionally installs Home Assistant and its frontend to execute the runtime integration tests, HACS validation, and Hassfest.
